* Integration tests using CLI
* Add some basic logging to storages, none of them have it.
	* Also some timing information to the upload view + UploadObjects function
* Test that tries to upload an HTML file and ensures it's not served as HTML.
    * Does this make sense? Isn't it more of a storage backend detail?
    * Maybe still test against dev files as a "better than nothing" test?
* Consolidate StoredFile and StoredHTML somehow.
* SanitizedKey should be required probably in storage Store*() interfaces, and have constructors for stuff like metadata key, paste raw file keys, etc
* Logging middleware to provide request logging
* Make file size accessible on StoredObject
* Add a way to create sub-loggers to the Logger interface, update uploads/uploads.go to use it
	* maybe works based on context instead of actual sub-logger?
* Go through and clean up messy tab/space indentation in templates
* Pastes
    * Remove plain text highlighter (probably after ANSI text added)
    * Syntax highlighting from Markdown
    * Unified diffs
    * Side-by-side diffs
    * Integration tests: regular, markdown, unified diff, side-by-side diff
    * ANSI colors
    * Fix catppuccin-frappe theme colors (background color, line numbers)
    * Line highlights not working, probably due to CSS changes
    * Auto-detection of languages not working
    * Return JSON
    * Metadata object
    * Consolidate text and paste CSS / HTML now that markdown was merged in
    * Fix "Copy & Edit" button on pastes
    * Use same filename for txt and HTML for pastes -- replicate https://github.com/chriskuehl/fluffy/pull/177
* Eliminate jQuery
* Eliminate all third-party resources (e.g. fonts)
* TODO assertions in views/uploads_test.go
