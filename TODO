* Integration tests using CLI
* Add some basic logging to storages, none of them have it.
	* Also some timing information to the upload view + UploadObjects function
* Test that tries to upload an HTML file and ensures it's not served as HTML.
* Consolidate StoredFile and StoredHTML somehow.
* SanitizedKey should be required probably in storage Store*() interfaces, and have constructors for stuff like metadata key, paste raw file keys, etc
* Logging middleware to provide request logging
* Make file size accessible on StoredObject
* Add a way to create sub-loggers to the Logger interface, update uploads/uploads.go to use it
	* maybe works based on context instead of actual sub-logger?
